# Button

Display a simple button.

Three variants are supported. `standard` and `outline` buttons look like traditional form buttons and are ideal candidates for 'Ok' and
'Cancel' options in most cases. `text` buttons are intended to be used inline in content blocks or for more subtle button options.
(Auth uses text buttons for the Forgot Password and Sign Up options.)

Four sizes are also supported. Most use cases will call for the `normal` size, but a `small` size is ideal for more subtle controls, such
as pagination or other secondary functions. `medium` buttons are slightly larger to provide balance in forms where other items are also
bigger, and `large` buttons are for cases where the page has mostly white-space and the buttons need to fill more space.

Icons may be placed either before ("start") or after ("end") the button label. Icons should be SVG objects passed as strings and will
be rendered as HTML inside the button label area. It is important that the root &lt;SVG&gt; tag contains a default `fill="#ffffff"` setting
for the base color, and that child elements below it do not. This allows the button color to carry into the icon properly.
