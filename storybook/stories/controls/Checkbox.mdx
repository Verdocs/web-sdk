# Checkbox

Displays a check box. Note that this is different from the `verdocs-field-checkbox` component, which is designed
to be used in signing experiences and contains settings that connect to template fields. This is just a simple check
box for UI displays e.g. dialog boxes.

This control encapsulates a standard HTML checkbox. To subscribe to change events, connect an `onChange`
handler.

<div className="tip-wrapper">
<span className="warning">NOTE</span> This control is meant to be used in application UI's. It is not for document
signing. Use `<verdocs-field-checkbox />` for that.
